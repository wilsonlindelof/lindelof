					<h2 style="font-size: 70px;">Our Story</h2>
					<p>Catie got back from a study abroad in Europe with no money and no job, looking for something to do in the mean time. Her sister encouraged her to (re)download Tinder and go on some dates in the meantime. She stumbled across an incredibly handsome, funny profile of a man who seemed to have his life together (graduated from college!) which was the polar opposite of her (will graduate eventually!). He owned a motorcycle and that intrigued her, so she swiped right. Within a few hours, Wilson messaged her and asked for some advice on a debate between coworkers. They bantered back and forth, and he asked her out on a date. </p>				
					<p>From the first time they met, something special was there. Their first date was playing Pokemon Stadium, and despite Wilson beating Catie at (practically) everything, she was excited for date number 2. Wilson took Catie to a beautiful pond and serenaded her with his harmonica, and they met a stray cat who followed them around. They held hands and talked for hours and kept making plans to see each other again and again. Quickly developing from "crush" to "couple," they have been inseparable since June 2016. Catie and Wilson have made many memories together including cave exploring, motorcycle rides in the desert, exploring the coast of Northern California, and helping each other move 6 times. It's been about a year of memory-making for these two, and they very much look forward to the memories to come. They couldn't have made it this far without the support of their friends and families.</p>
					<p>After the wedding, Wilson and Catie will be living in Orem, UT while Wilson continues working as a developer and Catie works at the hospital while finishing her nursing and Russian degrees.</p>

						<h1>Wilson <span>The Groom</span></h1>
						<p class="quest">Tell us about your self</p>
						<p>I recently graduated from BYU with my Masters in Information Systems. I love working as a developer and being able to exercise my creativity in my job. I served a mission in Budapest, Hungary, so I can understand a little about what Catie has gone through. I like most activities that involve going fast or being on the water. I dream of someday sailing the world, with Catie as my first mate of course.</p>
						<p class="quest">What do you like about your relationship with Catie?</p>
						<p>I love the face Catie makes when she is concentrated and trying hard to do something new. She has a spark of determination and energy that inspire me to do more. She's very good at showing people she cares for them. Catie is incredibly supportive, and makes every activity with her fun. I can't think of anyone else I would rather have by my side as we take on what life throws at us.</p>

						<h1>Catie <span>The Bride</span></h1>
						<p class="quest">Tell us about your self</p>
						<p>I am studying nursing and Russian with the hopes of working in a critical care environment. I served a mission in Yekaterinburg, Russia and love all of the people there. Because of that, I decided to continue my Russian education at BYU as well as study nursing. I love skiing and being outside as well as reading books and watching Netflix. I love getting to know other people and helping them which is why I have been so drawn to the medical field. </p>
						<p class="quest">What do you like about Wilson?</p>
						<p>I have always feel comfortable around Wilson because he has such a calming influence. He's funny and smart, and he is really quick at coming up with witty replies to things. I love that he's opinionated but doesn't feel the need to argue his opinions with people. He's a very respectful guy, and he treats me right, which is the most important thing. I know that Wilson prioritizes me above everyone else, and he is always trying to make me happy.</p>
